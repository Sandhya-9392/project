    <p>Here the people can place their complaints like 
        1. Long wait times
        By the time a customer calls you with a complaint, they’re already feeling frustrated. Putting them on hold or making them wait in a queue for a long time often exacerbates their issue.
        
        The fix: Long wait times could mean the volume is too high for your customer service team to handle. Take a look at the peaks and valleys in contact center demand, and try to staff those times to match. You may also be able to deflect some inquiries by including self-service options that enable customers to find solutions on their own. 
        
        2. Inability to speak with a human
        Automated phone systems or bots can help answer common questions, but callers get irritated when they get stuck in a loop without any way to talk to a live representative. 
        
        The fix: Offer direct support on various channels—phone, messaging apps, live chat, and email—and adopt an omnichannel customer service approach. This allows agents to easily switch between channels without losing customer context. For example, if someone reaches out to your support team on Facebook Messenger but then wants to speak to an agent over the phone, an omnichannel approach ensures your team can continue the conversation seamlessly.
        
        3. Unsupportive agents 
        Over 30 percent of consumers say friendly support agents are key to a good customer experience. When your agents don’t have the right customer service skillsfor the job, it leaves a bad impression on buyers. And when a customer is already upset, an unfriendly agent only escalates the situation.
        
        The fix: You’ll want to solve this customer service complaint proactively. Hire caring agents and provide empathy training for existing team members. A good service recovery program can also help remedy angry customers after the fact. For example, Birchbox encourages its agents to follow up with customers who rated their initial interaction poorly.
        
        4. Needing to repeat information
        Customers will start to feel frustrated if they have to repeat their issue multiple times, and they’ll reward businesses that save them from needing to do so. The Zendesk Customer Experience Trends Report 2022 found that 92 percent of consumers will spend more with companies that ensure they don’t have to repeat themselves. 
        
        The fix: Customer service software like Zendesk can remove this pain point from the process. The right tech stack can connect your agents with the information and context they need to effectively help a customer—no repetition required. Agents can see complete customer profiles so they can resolve issues faster.
        
        5. Inconvenient customer service hours 
        customer complaints
        
        We live in a world where people can order something online and have it delivered the next morning. So, it’s no surprise that consumers expect quick and convenient customer service. According to the Sprout Social Index, 40 percent of consumers expect a response from businesses within an hour, while 79 percent expect a reply within the first 24 hours.
        
        The fix: Provide support on-demand. An AI chatbot is a great way to expand your customer service hours. When agents are off the clock, a bot can handle the repetitive, basic queries that come in. Chatbots can also capture preliminary customer information and create tickets for agents to address when they’re back at their desks.
        
        Global companies may also want to try a follow-the-sun model, a type of workflow in which customer issues can be handled by and passed between offices in different time zones. This can help increase responsiveness and reduce wait times.
        
        6. Difficulty finding relevant information 
        Many customers want to take care of problems themselves: 83 percent will spend more with companies that allow them to find answers independently. Yet, only one-third of companies offer some form of customer self-service—whether through a help center, chatbots, or an FAQ page.
        
        The fix: A stellar knowledge management system is the best way to handle this complaint. But building a knowledge base or online community is only the first step. Customers also complain when self-service resources are out of date, so you’ll want to have a plan for refreshing your online content. An AI-powered knowledge base can flag outdated articles and recommend new ones to write. 
        
        7. Lack of support channel variety
        According to our CX Trends Report, 93 percent of consumers will spend more with businesses that offer their preferred communication channels, whether that’s email, phone, or text. 
        
        So if you offer support on only one channel, customers are likely to complain, especially if it’s a channel that’s inconvenient for them.
        
        The fix: Invest in channels that your customers frequently use. You want to meet customers where they are and make it easy for them to reach out via their preferred method. PayJoy, for example, integrated a chat tool into its customer service offerings—leading to a higher customer satisfaction score and a 55-percent decrease in inbound calls. 
        
        8. Poor service or product 
        Sometimes, customers simply aren’t going to like what you offer. While it might be tough to hear the criticism, listening to an upset customer can be a valuable learning experience. 
        
        The fix: When customers come to you with complaints about your products or services, take note of what they’re suggesting could be better. This can help inform growth decisions and ensure you’re always working to improve. 
        
        Benefits of customer complaints for your business
        Customers don’t complain just to make you look bad—they want you to respond with a solution and do better as a company. If you handle the feedback well, you can turn a negative situation into a positive one while learning along the way. 
        
        “Customer complaints are the biggest opportunity a business has to repair a fractured relationship with a customer.”
        Jonathan Brummel, director of enterprise support at Zendesk
        
        Though complaints may be disappointing, they’re also a valuable resource to gain a better understanding of your customers and what they need. Other benefits of negative feedback include: 
        
        Preventing a dissatisfied customer from churning
        Revealing customer pain points
        Building a positive brand reputation (if handled well)
        Creating opportunities for people to engage with your customer service team, leading to a better, more personal relationship with your brand
